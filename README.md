# WiseCamp - Project Management Tool

WiseCamp is a modern, intuitive project management application designed to help teams organize, plan, and execute their work efficiently. Built with a clean, Kanban-first approach, it brings projects, boards, and team collaboration into a single, streamlined experience.

This project was developed for **Therap JavaFest 2025** by **Team ArcaneBytes**.

## ‚ú® Features
